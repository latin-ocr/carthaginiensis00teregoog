The Play's of Terence are so 'dteingtnshed for the purest
Latinity, that they cannot be too soon placed in the hands ol'
the Student But the style of conversation is naturally so
elliptieal, that it presente some impedimento to „the young
learner. In th‘e present Edition notes have been added, which
will, it ls presumed, besides possessing other obvious advan-
tages, remove that difficulty. Another objectionhas been
made to Terence, of a more serious nature, and less easily
obviated, the immoral tendency of his plots. The Editor of
this book has 'successfully published some Phys of Pleume,
divested os every objectionable expression. But the indeli-
cate parts of Terence are so interwoven with his plots‚ that it
is extremely difficult to expungo the former, without destroy-
ing the oleamess and spirit of the latter. The attempt, how-
ever, has been made on the Andrium the success of which
will be determined by the judicious teaeher. Ἀ part of the
original has been necessarily omitted3 and it was found ex-
pedient, in order to preserve the connexion os the parts, to
introduce a very small number of new lines: but they ane
founded on ne authority orrerence him-serf, anrnttshoped,
will be thought not inconsistent with his diction and manner.
